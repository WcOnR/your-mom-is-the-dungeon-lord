story_description = "Shield on heart, and shield on shoulder,
Without this guard, my end grows colder.
Once I adored - now I attack,
Seems there's no way to turn us back. 
I built this shell from broken trust,
From every blow, from every gust.
I tried to run, but war ran too -
So now I wear what I lived through."
